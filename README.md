# TOTEM

An app for festivals, raves and all your nights out!

* Make a quick totem so your friends can find you in the crowd: type up a sign that flashes, take a picture, or use photo you already have.
* It's too loud to hear your friends over the music! Let your group know you're off to get water or some air, or to see the next set.
* Write up a quick, friendly message to all the people whose toes you just trampled :)
* SOS mode: send out an SOS text to phone contacts, with your GPS location on Google Maps.
* Air Horn: turn up the volume and blast an air horn noise to get attention!
