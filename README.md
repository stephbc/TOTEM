# TOTEM

An app for festivals, raves and all your nights out!

* Make a quick totem if your friends can't find you: make a sign, take a temporary pic, or use photo you already have.
* It's too loud to hear each other! Let your group know you're off to get water, a drink, air, the next set, etc.
* Write up a quick, friendly message to all the people whose toes you just trampled :)
* SOS mode: send out an SOS text with your GPS location!
